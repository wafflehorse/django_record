python -m 
    - Search sys.path for the named module and execute its contents as the __main__ module

pip freeze > requirements.txt
    - Since virtual environements are system specific, it is best not to pass around the virtual env, but instead pass around a requirements.txt created using pip freeze

python modules
    - a module is simply defined as a file containing statements and definitions.
    - when you run a module as a script (python fibo.py <arguments>), it runs the module with __name__ set to "__main__"
        - Which means, you can place code like such:
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                import sys
                fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
        - Often used for testing

python package
    - May contain multiple modules
    - Identified as a package with the __init__.py file in the package directory
    - Can define the behavior of "from package_name import *" by defining __all__ in init.py

running python in git bash
    - in order to run python in git bash, you must use "winpty python.exe <script> <args>"
